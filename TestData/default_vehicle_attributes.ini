; The speed algorithm must match one of the speed algorithms implemented by
; odas_p2mat.  Available algorithms include:
;   pressure - speed determined by pressure (ie, fall rate)
;   hotel    - speed data must be injected using an hotel file
;   glide    - fall rate and angle determin the fall rate
;   vector   - Three velocity vectors (U,V,W) are use to generate speed
;   constant - A constant speed is applied as determined by the constant_speed
;              parameter value.
